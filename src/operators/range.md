# Range operator

The `..` binary operator makes a half-open `range`.
The range `1 .. 5` represents a range including 1, 2, 3, and 4, but not 5.

A `range` in Onyx represents an interval between two integer numbers.
Ranges are used in two natural places in the language:
- `for` loops
- Making a slice
